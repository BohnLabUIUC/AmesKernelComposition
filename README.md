# Maize Kernel Composition: GWAS and Genomic Selection

Maize (*Zea mays*) kernel composition plays a critical role in diverse industrial applications and in feeding both humans and livestock. Understanding the inheritance and regulation of kernel traits—such as starch, protein, oil, fiber, and ash—is essential for targeted improvement to meet future demands.

## Objectives

- Identify genomic regions associated with kernel compositional traits  
- Predict breeding values using genomic selection models  
- Highlight candidate genes and actionable regions for breeding

## Materials and Methods

- **Germplasm**: 954 inbred lines from the Ames panel  
- **GWAS**: Mixed linear model (MLM) accounting for genetic relatedness  
- **GS**: Ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (**RR-BLUP**) model

## Key Results

- **Significant Associations**: 10 SNPs linked to five kernel quality traits  
- **Candidate Genes**: Identified in key genomic regions  
- **Prediction Accuracy (GS)**:
  - Starch: 0.41  
  - Fiber: 0.55  
  - Other traits: Moderate overall

## Conclusions

- Identified key loci and candidate genes for kernel quality traits  
- Demonstrated moderate GS accuracy, supporting its application  
- Laid groundwork for marker-assisted and genomic selection strategies in maize breeding
